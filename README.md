Words Transformer FX
=================================

# Introduction

**Words Transformer FX** is a JavaFX application. It is a simple tool that you can easily establish your database to pair words together. You may use this application to translate texts from one language into another language and to make sure that your words in your context are consistent.

# Usage

##### 1. If you have a database file named 'WordsData', you can put it into the directory where your 'WordsTransformerFX.jar' is. #####
##### 2. Run the program file named **WordsTransformerFX.jar**. #####
##### 3. Input a word or a keyword that you want to search. #####
##### 4. Copy the result.  #####
##### 5. If you want to edit the database file, you can input your 'keyword' and its corresponding 'value' and click the 'Add/Edit' button.  #####

# Database

If you want to do a mass of changes, you can use your text editor to open the database file named 'WordsData'. The structure of that file is very simple, like this:

    drake claws = 龍爪

or

    Fire Drake = 火龍戰士 --> 焰火龍

where '-->' is used for the history of that tuple and it can be repeated.
